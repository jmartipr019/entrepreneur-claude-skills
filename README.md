> **MetaAds setup note.** Unlike the other skills, MetaAds talks to a live API and spends real
> ad budget, so it needs Meta Marketing API credentials before it can do anything — walk through
> `skills/marketing-growth/MetaAds/workflows/Setup.md` first. It also requires `uv` on PATH to
> run its Python tools. Its internal paths are relative to the skill directory, so it works from
> any install location.

## Usage

Once installed, skills activate automatically based on your requests:

```
You: "Write a cold email sequence for my SaaS product"
→ cold-outreach skill activates

You: "Analyze my unit economics — CAC is $45, LTV is $380"
→ unit-economics skill activates

You: "Create an irresistible offer for my coaching program"
→ offer-creation skill activates

You: "Build an SOP for our customer onboarding process"
→ sop-builder skill activates
```

## Skill Format

Every skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` — a YAML frontmatter block plus the
workflow prompt. That single file is all a skill needs:

```
skills/category/skill-name/
└── SKILL.md          # Core skill file (YAML frontmatter + prompts)
```

Skills may add supporting files alongside it when the workflow calls for them. `MetaAds`
is the only one that currently does:

```
skills/marketing-growth/MetaAds/
├── SKILL.md          # Frontmatter + workflow routing
├── tools/            # Python scripts invoked by the workflows
└── workflows/        # Setup, PublishCampaign, AnalyzePerformance
```

### SKILL.md Frontmatter
